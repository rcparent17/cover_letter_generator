plaintext_experience:
  devops_engineer: |
    Created, maintained, and owned several large-scale GitHub Actions and Jenkins software build pipelines. Automated code coverage and unit testing for development teams. Migrated pipelines from legacy platforms to modern ones. Managed monthly production-signed software releases. Containerized build processes. Created and implemented git branching strategies for CI/CD.

    * Created a software integration pipeline that consumed, compiled, tested, and integrated C code from 100+ software teams, reducing time to build by 40%, automating static code analysis, and vastly simplifying the testing and integration processes.

    * Developed GitHub Actions pipelines to containerize and replace legacy Jenkins pipelines, improving build reliability and making them hardware-agnostic.

    * Reduced the time needed to create a production-signed software release by 90% by automating the process with a Jenkins pipeline that properly configured 200+ involved git repositories for each release.

    * Tested build pipelines with new Docker containers / infrastructure generated by Terraform to ensure functional equivalency, leading to minimal downtime during backend infrastructure migrations.

    * Owned component build pipelines, ensuring their functionality and availability by serving as a subject matter expert and first point of contact when problems and user requests arose.

    * Supported GCP operations (including Compute Engine and Kubernetes / GKE), ensuring sufficient compute power and build agent availability for CI/CD pipelines.
  product_development_co_op: |
    Rotated to different software teams doing DevOps work. Built out some of the first CI/CD processes in the powertrain department. Reworked legacy software processes to function with industry standard tools.  

    * Completed an undergraduate co-op thesis project that resulted in a new powertrain application build system, completely decoupled from legacy tools that were hard coded into the prior process, resulting in a 75% decrease in build time.

    * Ensured build agents were consistently available by implementing Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters into powertrain OpenShift infrastructure.
